    description: What is BitBadges? Our project utilizes a blockchain mechanism where users can associate with other user(s) through a NFT that is linked to the recipient's public key (no selling it). So once you earn a badge, no one can take it away from you!

# Present and The Future
This page outlines some of the current features we are currently working on and planning to work on in the near future! This page will be updated occasionally.

## Open Source
This project is open source, so if you would like to help with any of the features below, please do. Compensation will be awarded in the form of BitBadges creator coin or $CLOUT. Join the discord at [discord.gg/TJMaEd9bar](discord.gg/TJMaEd9bar) to discuss!

## Currently Working On
- Improving the UI, UX and ease of use for desktop users
- Growing the community and expanding partnerships
- Adding lots of features to the backend such as collecrtions, categories, hidden badges
- Profile customization where you can show off your best badges along with advertise ones you are offering

## Plans for the Future
- More support for hosting content within the BitBadges website
    - Ex: Having BitBadges as the place where you actually host your course instead of hosting it externally
    - Potentially partner with other BitClout projects working with premium content
- Explore possibilities of getting badges integrated on the BitClout chain itself instead of using [@BitBadgesHash](https://bitclout.com/u/BitBadgesHash) and posting the hashes
    - Can be stored just how a post or a message would be with a sender, recipient, image, description, etc
- Payment options and auctions to allow creators to sell their badges for BitClout or other currencies
- Possible integration with [@CloutContracts](https://cloutcontracts.net/) as an interoperable sidechain for badge issuing.
