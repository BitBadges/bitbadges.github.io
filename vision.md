# Present and The Future
This page outlines some of the current features we are currently working on and planning to work on in the near future! This page will be updated occasionally.

## Open Source
This project is open source, so if you would like to help with any of the features below, please do. Compensation will be awarded in the form of BitBadges creator coin or BitClout. Join the discord at [discord.gg/TJMaEd9bar](discord.gg/TJMaEd9bar) to discuss!

## Currently Working On
- Integrate BitBadges into [@cloutfeed](https://bitclout.com/u/cloutfeed)
- Improving the  UI, UX and ease of use
- Growing the community and expanding partnerships

## Plans for the Future
Possibly getting it integrated into profiles on @cloutfeed or a similar open source feed.
Payment options and auctions to allow creators to sell their badges for BitClout or other currencies
More support for hosting content within the BitBadges website
Ex: Having BitBadges as the place where you actually host your course instead of hosting it externally
Potentially partner with other BitClout projects working with premium content
Explore possibilities of getting badges integrated on the BitClout chain itself instead of using @BitBadgesHash and posting the hashes
Can be stored just how a post or a message would be with a sender, recipient, image, description, etc
Working to integrate other methods of issuing badges besides manually by the issuer
Through claiming - submitting a claim for a badge and then issuer can approve/deny the issuance of the badge
Explore possibility of creating NFT accounts that set Founder Reward to 100%, buy 1 coin and distribute it to the purchaser. 
Its a stretch but possible integration with @CloutContracts as an interoperable sidechain for badge issuing.
Support for transferring of ownership of badges
