    description: What is BitBadges? Our project allows any BitClout user to associate with any other user(s) through a NFT that is linked to the recipient's public key (no selling it). So once you earn a badge, no one can take it way from you!

# Potential Use Cases
Because you can create a badge for anything, there are infinitely many possible use cases for BitBadges!

## Potential Use Cases
- **BitClout Verification Badges** - Any BitClout account can give out verification badges and you can chooose which person/entity to get your verification ticks from.
- **Memberships/Subscriptions/Access Tokens** - Badges have optional start and end dates, so you can offer a limited time membership for anything from a gym membership to a Spotify subscription. Proof of ownership is easily done through our public API.
- **Premium Content** - Any creator who wishes to offer premium content can do so through badges.
- **Recognition of Achievement or Completion** - Job certifications, awards, athletic accomplishments, etc.
- **Peer to Peer University** - Professors can offer their courses directly peer to peer with any method of their choosing and offer a certificate of completion badge. This way, teachers can finally get the compensation they deserve as they can directly benefit from the monetization of BitClout.
- **Government Issued Tokens** - Trusted centralized parties like the government can issue badges for anything like vaccinations or felonies.
- **University Diplomas** - Universities can offer diplomas to students as a badge.
- **Publications** - Verify you are the author of a publication
- **Smart contracts** may eventually be used to issue badges which eliminates the need for trust between a creator and an individual.
